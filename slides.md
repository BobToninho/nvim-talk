# The **Vim** part

- Text editor
  - ðŸ§  with **mnemonic** keyboard shortcuts
  - âš¡ providing a **fast** editing experience
  - and a steep learning curve :)
- It's not
  - all-in-one software like emacs
  - IDE
    - even though pepole like to try to make it so
- [(but can be used to solve advent of code problems...)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P7yTg1SdNNQ&ab_channel=denvaar)

# The **Neo** part

- On top of vim
- Configuration via Lua
  - Simple to read and write
  - Fully fledged programming language
- Modern language stuff like auto completion, go to definition, syntax highlighting...
  - Almost anything you can find in VS Code
- (for me) Fuzzy search of files, file contents, help docs
  - (via a plugin)

# Why not stick to VS Code and avoid headaches?
- True, it offers everything a developer needs
- Can also be configured in many aspects
- ...but I want more...
- (...and it's slow to open)

# **My** editor

- I want...
    - _speed of typing_
    - to use the mouse as less as possible
    - to add custom functionality 
    - to have control on more things that happen while developing
